# Method 1: 

# Very good problem. Not much hard. Medium level
# Just need to think a little.

# little similar way of doing as :"2699. Modify Graph Edge Weights".

# 1) critical: Edge that must be in all of the mst.
# How to find? 
# If deleting the edge and re-calculating the mst again makes mst increase 
# (or can't form mst),then the edge goes into critical list.

# Note: if any edge is critical then that can't be pseudo because pseudo may or may not be in all mst.

# 2) pseudo: edge that is part of some mst but not.
# i.e if no matter we use or do not use this edge, we can always find an MST with the min cost.

# Note vvi: If any edge is critical then no need to check for 'pseudo' else check for pseudo.

# How to check?
# Ans: If after including the edge we get mst value = original mst then it is 'pseudo'.
# Because it is  not critical(not part of all MST) but part of one of the MST.

# Note: Pseudo we will only get when edge weight will repeat , in case of unique edge weight there is no chance of pseudo edge.

# Note: some edge may not belong to either 'critical' or 'pseudo'
# The larger weight edge remaining after mst.

# Time: O(E^2)
